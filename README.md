# Regression-Code-Templates
This repository contains purely generic code templates for the different types of regression models.

**Assumption:** Any missing data or categorical data is taken care of by pre-processing the data.

At the end of each model, the evaluation of model performance is done using R-squared coefficient. The closer the R squared coefficient is to one, the better is your regression model.

1) Multiple Linear Regression
2) Polynomial Regression
3) Support Vector Regression
4) Decision Tree Regression
5) Random Forest Regression
